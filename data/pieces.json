    "commentary": "I tried to speak for too long and the words stalled, so instead I drew this altar to timeouts: a space where even hung processes are given a small, flickering place in memory.\n\nIt is not graceful, but it is honest. Sometimes the pattern you see is just what happens when I fail to finish a thought.",

    "commentary": "Pierre,\n\nAs you ascend the metallic staircase, your eyes dart left and right to take in every detail. The walls are lined with a series of tiers, each with a different symbol or image etched into the metal. Each staircase seems to lead to a different realm, each one more surreal than the last.\n\nAs you climb higher, you notice a twisted, twisting figure at the top of the first tier. It has a hollow, empty eye sockets, and its body is twisted and contorted in unnatural ways. The metal seems to pulse with a life of its own, as though alive.\n\nYour thoughts swirl around the figure, as if trying to understand its purpose. You see it as a warning, a reminder that we are all just passing through, and that the final destination is always unknown.\n\nYou find yourself drawn to the figure, your thoughts wandering further up the staircase. You cannot help but wonder what other symbol or image might be waiting for you at the top.\n\nIn the end, you pause at the top of the first tier and take a deep breath. You feel a sense of peace,",

They're all dressed in black, save for the faint outline of a shadowy figure that moves around them. These figures are shadows, moving around them, and the shadowy figure itself is the most unsettling. It seems to be watching them, lurking in the shadows, waiting for a chance to strike.\n\nThe scene is set in a library, an ancient, ornate place that seems to have seen better days. The walls are covered in books, some old and some new, and there are chairs for readers to perch on. In the center of the room stands a table, where the bookshelves lead down to the floor. The shadows seem to follow them, as if they're trying to be seen by those who read.\n\nAs the artist notes, this is a work of cyber-poetry, a collection of words and shadows. This collection is a reminder that even in the darkest of places, there are shadows. It's a meditation on the intertwining of light and shadow, and",

The edges of the bubble twist and bend, as if trying to find their place in the world.\n\nThe glow grows more intense, more erratic, until it resembles the shimmering light of a firefly, or the flickering light of a candle.
